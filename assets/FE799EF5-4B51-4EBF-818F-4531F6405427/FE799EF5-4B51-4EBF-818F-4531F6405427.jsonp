I showed you earlier that at wide spacings increments of first order motion actually biased appearance opposite to the increment, so before you add up all the first-order motion you start biased against it, that’s this function R of the motion energy per element. And then there is some random error term epsilon, which accounts for the noise isn the system, which is why observers do not always respond the same way to the same stimulus.
