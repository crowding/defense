Here the horizontal axis measures spacing, and the vertical axis measures the proportion of responses clockwise. The energy of first order and spacing of second order motion are fixed so this is purely showing the effects of number and density for some otherwise fixed stimulus. I’ve shown three example observers here. In NJ, it’s apparent that adding more elements increases the probability that they will respond clockwise, while changes in spacing appear to do little. In NS, it even appears that increasing the spacing increases the propensity to respond clockwise a bit. On the other hand for PBM, increasing spacing steeply decreases the response probability, while changing the number of elements appears to do little.

For example if someone is very sensitive to position-defined motion then increasing the spacing would increase the visibility of position-defined motion like PBM. On the other hand if someone is more relatively sensitive to first-order motion we would expect that adding elements. And if the observer has a lot of repulsion going on, then increasing the spacing might slightly increase the repulsion, depending on how repulsion works.","targetRectangle":{"y":772,"x":537.4000003784895,"width":480.578125,"height":152}},{"text":"\tThe important thing is not all the different shapes you see, but whether those shapes are consistent with the sensitivities I measured in experiment 1.","targetRectangle":{"y":924,"x":537.4000003784895,"width":469.6640625,"height":57}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":true,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":512},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1024,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":512},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.000369224076798028,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":15,"height":1024,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":512},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1024,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"4E8EFB2FD78A0012249B769BA4F3AB62"}]}]}}]} } )
