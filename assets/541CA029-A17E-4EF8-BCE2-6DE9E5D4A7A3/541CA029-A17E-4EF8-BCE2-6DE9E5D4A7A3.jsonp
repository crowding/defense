notes\u2028\tSo boiled down a little more, there are these three effects of underlying the appearance of motion. \u2028\tHere (build) I’m plotting the sensitivity to position defined motion, as a function of spacing, sort of collapsing those two dimensional graphs into what is going on around one axis. The measurement of sensitivity can be a bit noisy particularly if the sensitivity is not high to begin with; but I think the model has captured something about what is going on.\u2028\t(build) As far as first order motion, I had built a model which says that the first order motion system adds up the energy of each element, linearly without an upper limit, and these are fairly strong assumptions but they appear to be borne out the sensitivity being quite linear in relation to the number of elements.","targetRectangle":{"y":772,"x":4,"width":988.6734378784895,"height":234}},{"text":"\t(build) Again this linearity starts out with a deficit — at the left side of each of these, increments of first-order motion cause biases in the opposite direction, which translates to negative values of sensitivity.
